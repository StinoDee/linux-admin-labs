DAY 24 — BUILD YOUR OWN DOCKERFILE
==================================

What is a Dockerfile?
---------------------
A Dockerfile is a blueprint used to build a Docker image.
It contains step-by-step instructions for creating a container image.

Basic Structure of a Dockerfile
--------------------------------
1. FROM        → Base image
2. WORKDIR     → Set working directory
3. COPY        → Copy files into container
4. RUN         → Install packages / run commands
5. EXPOSE      → Open a port
6. CMD         → Default command to run

Example Dockerfile (Python Flask App)
--------------------------------------

FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Key Concepts Learned
--------------------

✔ Images are built in layers
✔ Each instruction creates a new layer
✔ Docker caches layers to speed up builds
✔ Smaller base images = smaller final image
✔ .dockerignore prevents unnecessary files from being copied
✔ Containers should be lightweight and single-purpose

Build Command
-------------

docker build -t myapp .

Run Command
-----------

docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp

Why Dockerfiles Matter
----------------------

• Reproducible environments
• Portable applications
• Consistent deployments
• Foundation for Docker Compose
• Required for production systems
