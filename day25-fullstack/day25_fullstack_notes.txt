DAY 25 — BUILD FULL STACK WITH DOCKER COMPOSE
=============================================

Project Goal
------------
Connect a backend application to a database using Docker Compose.

Architecture
------------
Client (curl / browser)
        ↓
NGINX (reverse proxy)
        ↓
Flask Web App (Python)
        ↓
PostgreSQL Database

Services Used
-------------

1. web  → Flask application
2. db   → PostgreSQL database
3. nginx (optional if added) → Reverse proxy

Key Concepts Learned
--------------------

✔ Multi-container applications
✔ Service-to-service communication
✔ Docker Compose networking
✔ Internal DNS (service names like "db")
✔ Environment variables
✔ Container logs debugging
✔ Rebuilding services properly
✔ Port mapping vs internal ports

Important Lessons
-----------------

• Containers communicate using service names
• "localhost" inside container ≠ host machine
• Port 5432 is internal between containers
• Use docker compose logs to debug
• If network breaks → docker compose down -v

Common Debug Commands
---------------------

docker compose ps
docker compose logs web
docker compose logs db
docker compose exec web bash
docker network ls
docker network inspect <network>

Build & Run
-----------

docker compose up --build -d

Test
----

curl localhost:5001

Status
------
Full Stack Application Running
Web connected to Database successfully
