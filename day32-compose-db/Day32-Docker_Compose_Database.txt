Day 32 – Docker Compose with Persistent Database

Docker Compose manages multi-container apps.

Services can depend on each other.

Postgres data stored in named volume.

Volumes survive container restart.

Compose auto-creates:

Network

Volume

docker compose down removes containers.

docker compose down -v removes volumes.

Real-world production setup:
App + Database + Persistent Storage.

There are 3 levels of Docker issues:

User permission problem

Docker daemon problem

Kernel / runtime problem
