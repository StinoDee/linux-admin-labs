DAY 26 – DOCKER NETWORKING SUMMARY

1. Bridge Network:
- A bridge network is the default type of user-defined Docker network.
- It allows containers to communicate with each other on the same network.
- Each container gets a private IP and connects via the bridge.
- Supports custom subnets and gateways.

2. DNS Resolution:
- Docker provides an embedded DNS server (127.0.0.11) for containers on the same user-defined bridge network.
- Containers can resolve each other by name (container_name) instead of IP.
- Works only when containers are on the same network.

3. Isolation:
- Containers on different networks cannot communicate unless explicitly connected.
- Default bridge network isolates containers by default.
- Isolation enhances security and prevents unwanted communication.

4. Network Connect:
- Running containers can be attached to a network dynamically using:
  docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>
- Containers can also be detached from a network with:
  docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>
- This allows flexible multi-container communication without restarting containers.
