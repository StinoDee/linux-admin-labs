Day 12 – systemd Debugging Lab

Service: brokenlab.service

Initial failure:
- ExecStart pointed to a non-existent binary
- systemd returned status=203/EXEC
- Service entered restart loop and hit start-limit

Debugging steps:
- systemctl status brokenlab
- journalctl -u brokenlab

Fix applied:
- Corrected ExecStart to a valid command
- Reloaded systemd daemon
- Restarted service

Key lesson:
systemctl status + journalctl are essential for diagnosing service failures.
