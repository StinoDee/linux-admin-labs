Day 16 – Process Control & Signals

- Signals control process behavior
- SIGTERM is safe, SIGKILL is force
- nice/renice manage CPU priority
- Zombie processes need parent cleanup
- strace shows real system calls

- Verified SIGSTOP puts process in T (stopped) state
- SIGCONT resumes execution
- Processes may exit naturally before kill is issued
"No such process" means PID no longer exists

- renice only works on existing processes
- Processes may exit before priority change
- nice sets priority at launch
- renice modifies running processes
- strace (not trace) is used for syscall tracing
