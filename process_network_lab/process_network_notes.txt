Day 15 – Process, Network and Service Correlation

Flow:
Port → PID → Process → systemd Service

Commands:
- ss -tulpn
- ps -fp
- systemctl status
- /proc/PID inspection

Key insight:
Services manage processes; processes own ports.
Restarting a service changes PID but keeps the port.

/proc/<PID>/fd requires root if the process is owned by root.
