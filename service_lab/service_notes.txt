DAY 9 – systemd Timers, Sockets & Dependencies

1) Commands used for timers
- systemctl list-timers
- systemctl status mylab.timer
- systemctl start|stop mylab.timer
- systemctl enable|disable mylab.timer
- systemctl daemon-reload

Timers replace cron by using systemd units.
They trigger services based on time or events.

2) How socket activation works
- A .socket unit listens on a port or IPC socket
- systemd starts the related .service ONLY when traffic arrives
- Improves performance and reduces resource usage
- Example:
  ssh.socket → ssh.service

3) Dependency exploration
- systemctl list-dependencies <unit>
- systemctl list-dependencies --reverse <unit>
- Wants= : soft dependency
- Requires= : hard dependency
- After= / Before= : order only, not dependency

Key learning:
systemd manages startup order, activation, and relationships
between services using unit dependencies.
Day 8 – Services & systemctl

- systemctl manages system services
- status shows health and logs
- enable/disable controls boot persistence
- journalctl shows service logs
- Stopped or failed services can indicate attacks or misconfigurations
